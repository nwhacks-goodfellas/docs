# Presentation

We believe that students should pursue a career they are passionate about. Students should spend more time building their skills and networking and less time writing cover letters and resumes. We give people the power to manage their job applications and know when to make moves through every step of the process.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Landing from './components/Landing';

class App extends Component {
  render() {


    return (
      <div>
        <Landing />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```
